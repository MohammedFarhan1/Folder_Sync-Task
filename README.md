# FolderSync: Automated Folder Comparison and Synchronization Tool

## Overview

FolderSync is a Python-based tool designed to compare the contents of two directories and synchronize them automatically. It is ideal for ensuring that both folders contain the same files, whether you're managing backups, development environments, or any other paired directories.

## Features

- **Folder Comparison**: Compares the contents of two folders, identifying missing, extra, or differing files.
- **Automatic Synchronization**: Automatically syncs the folders based on the comparison results.
- **Snapshot Logging**: Saves the current state of the folders in an Excel file for future reference.

## Installation

1. **Download and Setup**:
   - Download the project files.
   - Place the downloaded files directly into the `D:/` or `E:/` directory on your computer.
   - Make any necessary modifications to the code or configuration before running.

2. **Running the Tool**:
   - Navigate to the directory where the project is placed (`D:/` or `E:/`).
   - Run the Python script by executing the following command:
     ```bash
     python FolderSync.py
     ```

3. **Post-Run Instructions**:
   - After running the script, open the `Folder_sync` Excel file generated by the tool.
   - Navigate to the second sheet, titled `Last_Snapshot`.
   - Review the snapshot details, then close the Excel file before making any further modifications.
   - After closing the Excel file, you can rerun the Python script to sync the folders again.

## Usage Notes

- Ensure the tool is placed and run from either the `D:/` or `E:/` directory.
- The Excel file generated (`Folder_sync.xlsx`) contains critical information. Always review the `Last_Snapshot` sheet before running the tool again.
- Remember to close the Excel file after reviewing and before making any further changes or running the script again.
